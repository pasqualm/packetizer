Wbusy.exe version 1.01 (c) 2008-2011, Horst Schaeffer
-----------------------------------------------------

This little program displays a busy indicator window while a time-consuming batch process is running. To close the window, or to replace it with a "done" message, run the program again with the /stop parameter.

++++ Syntax to start the busy indicator (Start mode): 

     START Wbusy "Title" "Text" /count /marquee

The title is mandatory. Title and text must be enclosed in double quote marks. 
Optional style: /Marquee or /Count (Marquee is only available with Windows XP+)
Default Style is a mock marquee (text mode).


Example: START Wbusy "Image Batch" "Processing files" /marquee

It is important to use the START command, because this will let the batch continue. 
The window can be aborted with the [x] button (title bar) or ESC. 


++++ Syntax to stop a running busy indicator (Stop mode): 

     Wbusy "Title" "Text" /stop /sound /timeout=n

This will kill the first instance, IF THE SAME TITLE IS GIVEN 
(otherwise the first instance cannot be identified).

If a text is given, a new window with an OK button will replace the first instance. If no text is given, the first window will just vanish. 

The /stop parameter is mandatory for this mode.
Optional: /sound (Windows default sound)
Optional: /timeout=n (n seconds until the window will be closed)

Example: Wbusy "Image Batch" "All files done; errorlevel: %errorlevel%" /stop /sound

In the text string the token $sec will be replaced by the number of seconds the first instance has been running. 

Example: Wbusy "Image Batch" "All files done ($sec seconds)" /stop 

When the second instance (Stop mode window) is run without START (or with START /WAIT), the batch process will be halted until the window is closed. 


++++ Notes:

In the text string you may use the caret character (^) for line breaks. 
To show double quote marks, use two single quote marks. 
Case ignored for options. 
ESC key closes the window. 

It is also possible to replace a busy indicator with a new one without /stop. Just make sure the same title is used.

Wbusy does not report any syntax errors. Please test to see whether it works.
You can test the Wbusy windows on the command line (START not required).
